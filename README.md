# Portfolio Allocation Using Fama French VS Sample Estimates

This project demonstrates portfolio allocation techniques using two approaches: the Fama-French model and sample-based estimates. It compares the effectiveness of these methods in constructing efficient portfolios and highlights key differences in performance and risk-return characteristics.

## Contents

- **Introduction**: An overview of portfolio allocation concepts and the Fama-French model.
- **Data Collection**: Steps to load and preprocess historical data for asset returns, including Fama-French factors.
- **Portfolio Allocation Models**: Explanation of both methods:
  - **Fama-French Model**: A multifactor model considering market, size, and value risk factors.
  - **Sample Estimates**: A classic approach using historical data for mean and covariance calculations.
- **Performance Comparison**: Analysis of portfolios created using both methods, with a focus on risk-adjusted returns.
- **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and insights on model effectiveness.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.7 or above
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` - for data manipulation
  - `numpy` - for numerical calculations
  - `matplotlib` - for plotting
  - `scipy` - for statistical calculations
  - `statsmodels` - for Fama-French factor modeling

To install the dependencies, you can use:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy statsmodels
```

## Usage

1. **Open the Notebook**: Load `Portfolio_Allocation_Using_Fama_French_VS_Sample_Estimates.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Run Cells Sequentially**: Follow the cells in order for a step-by-step guide to portfolio allocation.
3. **Experiment**: You can adjust parameters, data, and methods to observe different portfolio outcomes.

## Key Insights

This notebook provides an intuitive comparison of traditional portfolio allocation methods versus a factor-based approach. It is designed for educational purposes to help students and practitioners understand portfolio optimization better.
